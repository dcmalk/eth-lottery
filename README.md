# eth-lottery

The lottery contract functions like a raffle, with a prize pool and a list of players. Players send in some amount of ETH to the contract to enter the lottery. The first player, assumed to be the manager player, can initiate the random selection of a winner. The contract then sends the prize pool to that winner.
